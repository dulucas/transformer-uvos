# Transformer-UVOS
This is a repo offers a strong baseline for Unsupervised Video Object Segmentation(UVOS) using Transformer

## Accuracy
------
With Res50 as backbone and image size (640x352) during training, using only single-scale for testing
On DAVIS 2016:

J_mean | J_recall | J_decay | F_mean | F_recall | F_decay
-- | -- | -- | -- | -- | -- 
0.777 | 0.915 | 0.066 | 0.766 | 0.859 | 0.043
